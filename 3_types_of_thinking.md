# 3 Types of Thinking

I’ve noticed 3 types of thinking:
* Focused thinking
* Calm thinking
* Chaotic thinking

This is an oversimplification and has no scientific proof what so ever. Just a simple model. it’s not entirely correct nor complete. I don’t say anything about subconscious thinking or anything like that. But I believe it would help me describe the point. Let start with the list of definitions first:

## Focused thinking
Focusing on one problem without any distractions.

## Calm thinking
Don’t think about anything in particular in any given moment. Thoughts come and go without you focusing, worrying or trying to solve them.

## Chaotic thinking 
By chaotic thinking I mean when your brain jumps from topic to topic from problem to problem from idea to idea. Kind of partially solving them, but not really. Scanning all the staff you think you might or have to do. Sort of multitasking and jumping back and forth.

Chaotic thinking is by far is the greediest one. If you don’t train your brain to control it, it will invade other types of thinking. It will be hard for you to focus on anything. Hard to calm down your overactive brain.

## Ways to calm your mind:
1. Meditation
2. Writing as thinking (journaling)
3. Speaking as thinking (in front of a mirror for instance)
